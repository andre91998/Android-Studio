# Building your First User Interface

## Important Concepts

* The user interface (UI) for an Android app is built as a hierarchy of layouts and widgets:

  * **Layouts** are **ViewGroup objects** (containers that control how their child views are positioned on the screen)

  * **Widgets** are **View objects** (UI components such as buttons and text boxes)

* Android Studio UIs are defined in XML files, which can be written or automatically generated with Android Studio's Layout Editor (used in this tutorial)
